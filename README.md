# Container Tabs Manager

**Container Tabs Manager** is a Firefox extension that helps users manage their container tabs efficiently.

It allows you to close all tabs of a container and restore them in the same container, anytime later. For example, you want to close all tabs for your "work" container after your day, and restore them in the morning.

The extension uses the browser local storage to store light version of firefox tabs.

It requires the usage of the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/

***
Careful : this extension does not sync the tabs across Firefox account, it is ONLY LOCAL for now
